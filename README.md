# Analysis-of-product-categories-across-their-market-and-region

# Project Title:
Analysis & visualization of product categories, across their market and region using Python matplot library.

# Problem Statement
An organization called product based company publishing their
problem statement in 2011 hackthon. Now the organization wants
tabular data into visualization format, as a data science Engineer.I
have to provide solution for following Task.

# Tools:
1. Jupyter Notebook.
2. Python Programing Language.
3. Numpy (Python Libery_)
4. Google Colab.


# Conclusion :
# Bar Graph :
Bar graphs are a convenient method to represent different sets of data. Apart from this, these types of graphs are easy to describe the maximum and minimum profi ts values across sales.
# Scatterplot :
Scatterplots can visually show the maximum and minimum profi ts sales across different categories.whether there is a positive or negative association between the variables.All categories must be in different colors.
# Line Graph :
Line Chart is used to represent trend of sales over the 12 months with sales across the months with maximum and minimum values by representing the line value with hight peak vlaue.
# Histogram :
Here Histogram is used to represent the distibution of employees across different age groups checking the distribution of data range using maximum and minumum of with fixed number of bins.
# Box Plot :
Boxplot is used to Understanding the spread of sales across different countries.Based on these data it seems that divides the data based on the percentile values.It helps to identify the presence of outliers over the graph.
